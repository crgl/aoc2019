# Advent of Code 2019 - Julia

## To run

Use Julia to run the file `all_day.jl`. This won't work at the moment due to a bold look into hardcoding paths and my own file organization, so there's no need to go into too much detail about it

## Notes so far

Nothing yet! Julia is still potentially powerful and was a delight to do stats with; here's hoping it continues to pleasantly surprise throughout December.
